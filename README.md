# SYNOPSIS

    use Async::Template;
    blah blah blah

# DESCRIPTION

Stub documentation for Async::Template, created by h2xs. It looks like the

unedited.

Blah blah blah.

This [Async::Template](https://metacpan.org/pod/Async::Template) package uses "Template Toolkit" ([Template](https://metacpan.org/pod/Template))
as dependency and contains small amount modified parts of "Template Toolkit"
(modified grammar and continuous synchronous code which is splitted for
execution asynchronous sequences). The "Template Toolkit" was written
by Andy Wardley <abw@wardley.org> and contributors, see
Template::Manual::Credits for details and repos contributors sections.
